# My Open Source Computer Science Degree
This is my 100% online, self-programmed education! After completion, my education will be equivalent to that of a Bachelor of Computer Science with a focus in Data Science, and a minor in Sociology. This was inspired by <a href="https://github.com/ForrestKnight/open-source-cs">ForrestKnight's open source degree</a>.
